# Collision-with-lines
My CSCB58 final project. 

To run the game you need to use a MIPS assembly emulator such as [MARS](https://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/download.htm).
A demo of me running the game can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cCN9CAYXM8). Please this video was created for the course
